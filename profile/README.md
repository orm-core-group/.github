.NET Core Object/Relational Mapping(ORM) components

## Overview

Welcome to the .NET Core ORM Group! 

Our mission is to compile and maintain a comprehensive list of all open-source Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) components available for the .NET platform, providing developers with an accessible and searchable resource. 

ORM is an essential part of the development process, facilitating efficient mapping of object models to database structures.

## Our Goal

Our goal is to establish an exhaustive directory of .NET ORM components, including both well-known and lesser-known libraries. As long as they are open source and support the .NET framework, we are eager to include them.
